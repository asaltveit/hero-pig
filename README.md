# hero-pig

You’re a pig that has to defend your fellow pigs from attackers. You were bestowed with special powers from some aliens. Y’all are considered the most delicious in the world, so your enemies come from far and wide.

A 2D slide-scroller game developed in Godot.

## Why I built it this way

- I originally built it in Phaser3, since I was comfortable with JavaScript and wanted a web game. [Phaser repo](https://github.com/asaltveit/pig-game)
- I switched to Godot because there was more accessible documentation and built-in functionality.
- Background assets, like the road, are created in Krita while more usable/interactable assets, like the barn and fence, are created in InkScape. I want the background to have a dreamy quality. Plus, this will help the player know what is usable.
